Ate a good breakfast at Manfred's and left for Berlin with him driving. Arrived in Berlin in the afternoon and wandered around looking for a place to stay. Ended up at Jungegasthaus. Nothing to do at night but wander around some more and drink a few beers. Ended up in the red-light district being motioned to by the professionals there. Lonely.
