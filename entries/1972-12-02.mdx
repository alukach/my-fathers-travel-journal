Was told by some Africans from Senegal that the stores were closed on Saturdays so decided to leave. Then met some Americans who said that they were open so changed our minds again and decided to stay till Sunday. Went walking around Belgrade to the market, around the old town to the fortress overlooking the Sava + Danube Rivers, and then to the new town. Had a huge meal of cabbage rolls, slaw, noodles with cheese, pork with vegetables, and beer and then went to wash clothes. Was met by an old man who offered us a place to stay for 50 dinars. We accepted, went with him to discover it was a room with only one tiny bed so we had to pay another 10 dinars for another bed. A screw job but no big deal.
