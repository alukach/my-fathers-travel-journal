Left Salzburg on an early afternoon train and arrived in Vienna at 4:00PM. Went looking for a place to stay, found one that was too expensive and was told that the other place was already filled. Met up with Debbie and Tony and went with them to the hostel outside of the city. Too late to go out so played cards and went to bed early.
