In the morning went to see the Spanish Riding school... magnificent steeds. Then stopped at the St. Augustine wine cellar for a glass of wine (cheap -- only 30¢ for 8 oz). From there went to St Stephens Church, a beautiful Gothic structure with a tower. Could see all of Vienna from the top of the tower since it was a clean day. From the church went to the cooking school for lunch but it wasn't as cheap as I expected. Good food, though. Met two American girls there that went to the University in Vienna and was told of two other good wine cellars. Took a walk to one of them but it was closed until 4 P.M. Went back to St. Augustine's for another glass of wine and then to Esterházy Keller to meet the American girls. They didn't show but sat with an old man (74 yrs old) who was from Czechoslovakia and told me about the country. Drank many glasses of wine with him, got drunk, and left for the safety of the hostel. Went into another old church on the way, sat through mass and then met up with some Pakistani students who took me to the student club. Had another wine there and then retired to the hostel.
