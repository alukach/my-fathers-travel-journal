After midnight, switched trains at Plovdiv and ended up in a car with three young Bulgarians who wanted to buy my Levis, liked the Beatles and Rolling Stones, and long hair. Arrived in Sofia at 6 A.M. and walked to the youth hostel but the gate was locked. Finally got in but was told to come back after lunch to check in. Walked around town... went inside a couple of churches and then came back to check in. Met an English couple and went with them to eat dinner and then a long B.S. session. Slept.
