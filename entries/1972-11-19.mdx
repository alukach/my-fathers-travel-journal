Got on a train to Frankfurt at 11:40 and missed my connection in Hannover so had a delay. Arrived in Frankfurt at 7:30 and took a bus to Rhine-Main air base to look for Monte. Waited in the guard shanty for better than an hour... couldn't find him. Left at 10:00PM intending on going to the youth hostel in Frankfurt. Met up with George (of Cyprus) and Irene (of Essex, England) and discovered the hostel was already locked up for the night. Asked the police where we could stay and they directed us to the Bahnhof mission where Irene got a bed but George & I had to sleep(?) on the wooden benches.
