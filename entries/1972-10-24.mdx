Took the morning train out of Oslo for Bergen... beautiful country. In Bergen, got together with Ruth + Lauchie again as well as John and the 4 of us went to the police station to see if they might know of a place to stay. They were absolutely fantastic! Drove us to a university housing place where we spent the night for 20K apiece.
