Left Karlsruhe (on the Rhine) and headed for Munich again. A young traveling salesman picked us up and gave us his address in case we return to Karlsruhe. A German girl (Barbara Hauler) gave us a ride into Munich. Said she was going to be working in Troy, N.Y. as soon as she got a work permit.

Slept in the Y.M.C.A. which cost us too much money. Went to the Hofbräuhaus and had a few liters of beer. Met 2 chicks going to Innsbruck so we decided to go along.
