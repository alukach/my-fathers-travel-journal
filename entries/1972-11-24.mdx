Washed clothes and tried to find Marcos Santos but no luck. Went to the Deutsches Museum with Al from Jersey and ate at the Mensa in the University. Went out at night with Al and met up with Patrick, Goose, and a Malaysian named Mouse and a German (Werner). Had 3 liters and felt fine. Werner gave us a ride back to the hostel.
