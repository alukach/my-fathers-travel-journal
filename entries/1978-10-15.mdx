## Sunday (1 week)

No luck in Mainz so slept at the train station and caught another train into Frankfurt at 4 AM.

Took a train out of Frankfurt in the morning, heading for Amsterdam. Arrived in the afternoon and stayed at the "Brandery", a youth hostel. Cost 4 K a night. Hash cost 3 K a gram... good stuff. Got burned by a blond, however.
