Woke up to another beautiful day and went down to the main drag to buy some hot bread from the bakeries. Had breakfast and then went down to the beach to swim, lie in the sun, and read. Came back to the room late in the afternoon, had lunch, and at night went down to main drag for dinner. Played cards and drank a few bottles of retsina[^retsina]. Slept.

**9 weeks into the journey**
