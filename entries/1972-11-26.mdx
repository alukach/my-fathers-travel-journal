Pete left for Vienna but Pat & I decided to stay on. First thing to do was to sneak out in the morning to pick up my pack back at the hostel. Then back to the room to eat. In the afternoon, went for a long walk with Pat along another hill overlooking the city on the other side of the river. Got very hungry, so had dinner then back to the room. A good day.
