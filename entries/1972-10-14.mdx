Got a train out of Innsbruck to Munich and one out of Munich to Mainz (outside of Frankfurt). Found out that the best info about Monte Blanc was to be found in Frankfurt at a bar called the Kings Club. Took a train to Frankfurt and went to the bar, got goofed up and then went back to Mainz. Met Toby Buroughes at the Hofbräuhaus in Frankfurt.
