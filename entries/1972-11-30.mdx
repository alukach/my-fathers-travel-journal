Ate breakfast and was given 4 extra rolls to take along by the old woman in the kitchen. Had a long walk out to where we could hitch. Waited for ½ hour and had to go inside for a beer... too cold. After waiting some more and a few short rides finally got across the border into Yugoslavia. Not as far as Kranj and then took a bus to Ljubljana. Walked a long way looking for a place to stay. Ended up in an old hotel (?) with no heat 'cept for a space heater. Ate and went to sleep early, kinda depressed and very tired.
