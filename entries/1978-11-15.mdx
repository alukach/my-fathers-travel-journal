Could not stay at the Jungengasthaus another night because they were full. Took my gear down to the train station luggage room and checked it for the day. Saw the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche at Kurfürstendamm and walked around the city. Went to the hostel at Tegel (far from the center of the city) and met Brian + Rob from Conn. After eating went with them to the Big Eden discotek. Had to leave for the hostel at 11:00 P.M. to be back by lock-up at 12:00. Bummer.
