Left the hotel and went walking in the direction of the road to Zagreb. Stopped on the way for some good and cheap pastries for breakfast and then started to hitch. Long wait and no ride. A car stopped to pick us up... the same old man that had given us the ride across the border. Took us only a short distance but immediately got a ride from a Yugoslavian who took us to within 120 KM of Belgrade and bought us coffee, pepsi, & cognac along the way. Then caught a lift from a Frenchman on his way to Istanbul who let us off in Belgrade. Looked for a place to stay and met 2 young Yugoslavians that spoke very good English. They told us to go to a hostel and showed us a good restaurant where we could eat the barbecued lamb that is a specialty here. Had a beer with it, went and found a place to stay, and met an American and a Japanese. Had another beer with them and went to sleep. A very good day!
