Decided to get my Czech visa so took a train to Bonn. At Bonn, found out that all visas were handled in Frankfurt and jumped on another train to Frankfurt and after walking around for an hour looking for the Czech consulate finally found it but was informed that visas were only taken care of between 8 and 11:30 in the morning. That was enough for me! Went to the Hauptbahnhof and took the first train to Heidelberg. Went to the hostel and crashed.
