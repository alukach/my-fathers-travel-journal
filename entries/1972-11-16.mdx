After breakfast headed for Checkpoint Charlie to cross into East Berlin. Spent an hour at the Museum of the Wall before crossing over. In East Berlin went to see the Brandenburg Gate and a museum with Egyptian antiquities. Had a beer in a beer stube and a piece of cake & tea in a cafe before returning to the west. At night, went to the Pinte, a nice place with good music and good food. Then back to the hostel for lock-up again.
