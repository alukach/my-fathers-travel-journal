Left for Yugoslavia with Kathy and didn't have very good luck hitching but got as far as Klagenfurt, not far from the border. Went out to eat and then to a wine cellar where we met Tony, one of the kindest souls I've ever ran into in my life. He took us to his house where we drank schnapps, wine, and ate fruit until we had to go back to the hostel. A lonely man with a heart as big as the city. Felt sorry for him and hoped to see him again sometime. Got back to the hostel and went to sleep.
