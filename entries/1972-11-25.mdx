Went to Hauptbahnhof and took the 10:00AM train to Salzburg, arriving at noon. Walked to the hostel and had some food and then went out for a walk in the snow. Met Pat + Pete at the fortress and went strolling with them along the cliffs overlooking the city and then went down for some beer and food. Had a couple of beers in one place and then some food and rum (Pete's) & more beer in another. By the time we left (9:00 P.M.) and went over to their room, all of us were feeling no pain. Drank some more rum and went out for a walk with Pat. Couldn't go back to the hostel cause it was too late, so slept with Pat + Pete after sneaking past the lady that ran the place.
