Arrived in Stockholm at 9 A.M and met John again in the restaurant at the station. Decided to go to England for Guy Fawkes day. Went to the Modern Art Museum and to see the ship Vasa where I met Gary Robinson. Went with him to get the address at the Swedish girl's home where he was staying. Ate dinner there and watched TV and argued over Vietnam. Accepted the offer to stay the night.
