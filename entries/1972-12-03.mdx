Hot on the road out of Belgrade we got a ride from a Yugoslavian med student. He took us about 120 KM and we were then picked up by an Iranian truck driver on the long haul to Iran. Got off in Niš and met a student from the Sudan who helped us and then left us stranded. Decided to try to hitch out and got a lift to Skopje with a Yugoslavian truck driver. Look for a place to keep warm till morning (it was 2:30 A.M.) and ended up waiting in the cold first floor entrance to a hotel.
