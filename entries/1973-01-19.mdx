Woke up early and went over to American Express to pick up my money. When I got there, was told that there wasn't anything for me. Near panic but kept cool. Walked to the consulate to get help and discovered my money was there. Cashed it at the bank and went to the bazaar. When I returned to the hotel, I found that my ride had left without me. Decided to leave on Saturday no matter what.
