Took a bus into the center of the city and another out to the edge of town to begin hitching. Had to wait about 1 1/2 hours and then got a ride for about 40 KM. Immediately got another ride for another 60 KMs to Katerina and ate lunch there. Started hitching again and got one ride to Athens. Stayed at George's guest house for 50 DR each and went out and had a great meal.
