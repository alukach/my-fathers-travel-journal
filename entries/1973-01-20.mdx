Something seems to try to keep me in Istanbul... today my alarm clock set for 6:15 stopped running at 5:14. Left anyway. Took a bus to the border town (Edirne) and then a minibus to the border. Another bus from there to Svilengrad and then a train to Sofia. Good vibes... free tea in Edirne, help with directions in Svilengrad, good people in general. Strange to be riding on a Bulgarian train that has "BEE GEEs" written on the seat. Guy across from me with Janis Joplin tape.
