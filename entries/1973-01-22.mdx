Started the day with a cognac and a coffee at a cafe and then went to the U.S. Embassy to read the paper. Tried to find the student office "Orbit" to get a socialist student I.D. card but after walking around for over an hour, gave up. Walked back to the hostel for my towel & soap and then to the bath house for a shower and a mineral bath. Ate dinner and went back to sleep. Lecherous old man in the room.
