Met a Yugoslavian at a sidewalk stand who bought us a glass of wine and rapped about the world in general. Decided to bus out since we had some Dinars left and they won't be worth much at the border. Walked across the border and waited... almost no cars. A man stopped to pick us up on the Greek side and told me he was going to Thessaloniki. His name was Thanos and turned out to be a real Zorba! Stopped to buy us Ouzo and sausage + sardines and pickled cabbage and then on to the city. Took us to a taverna for more food (fish, meatball soup, more cabbage, more ouzo, retsina, beer, apples & oranges) and spent the night being entertained by his friends. A great group... fine dancers, singers, & guitar and bouzouki players. Got loaded and stuffed and slept in the home of one of Thanos' friends.
