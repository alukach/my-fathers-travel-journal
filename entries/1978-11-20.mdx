Had to leave the mission at 6 A.M. so went to the station for a cup of coffee. Caught a train to Bingen-Am-Rhine to view the valley from atop the Klopp Castle. Walked up to the Castle through the rain... visibility wasn't good at all. Stopped in a beer stube for a glass of local white wine. Tasted so good that I had to buy a bottle along with cheese, wurst, bread, & mustard. Went back to Frankfurt and had lunch along the river... still raining. Thought of spending the day in a museum but they were all closed on Mondays. Ended up back at the hostel and met Monte at the base at 5:00 P.M. Had dinner with him and his girl and then went to bed.
