Woke at 4 a.m. to catch the bus. A long ride to Sanandaj, getting there at about 5 p.m. Walked to John's house with a crowd of people and had a good reunion with Slone. Went then back to the bus station to catch a bus to Kermanshah. Met Connie, Steve, and John in Kermanshah and got stoned and drank beer.
