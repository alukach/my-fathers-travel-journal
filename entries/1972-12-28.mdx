Slept late again and then had another lunch and very good meal. Walked around the bazaar and then went back to the room for a nap and to read for the rest of the afternoon. Feeling very lazy but digging it. After dinner, went down some small streets to a house where the Dervishes meet for their religious ceremony. Had tea and smoked a few cigarettes before the ceremony began. Then chanting and drums till the Dervishes were in a trance. They stuck long needles and knives through their cheeks, tongue, and stomach and the leader swallowed about 10 razor blades. Afterwards had another tea and went home to bed. What a trip!
